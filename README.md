# Laptop Price Pridiction Using Machine Learning

## Overview

As part of a data-driven project during my internship at CodeTech, i conducted a predictive analysis using a machine learning model to estimate laptop prices based on thier specifications. The main objective was to understand how various features such as display size ,processor, RAM , storage type, and GPU contribute to the final price of a laptop . By applying data prprocessing,visualization, and regresssion model techniques, i was able to derive meaningful insights from a structured dataset and create a model capable of making reliable price predictions.

## Tools Used

Python:
served as the primary programming language due to its extensive ecosystem of libraries for data manipulation and ML.

Pandas:
Used for reading and processing CSV data , managing missing values , and preparing features.

Matplotlib and Seaborn:
These libraries were used for data visualization , including scatter plots and heatmaps, t observe relationships and correlations between variables.

Scikit-learn(sklearn):
A powerful machine learning library used for implementing linear regression , train-test splitting, feature scaling and evaluating model performance.

## Task Description 

1.loaded and cleaned a laptop dataset by removing missing values and outliers

2.Visualized data trends using scatter plot nd heatmap to obe=serve correlations.

3.Encoded categorical variables using one-hot encoding.

4.Normalized features using StandardScaler.

5.Applied linear regreession to predict laptop prices based on specifications.

##Real World Applications

E-commerce platforms: Dynamic pricing for online electronic stores.

Retail analytics: Assisting retailers in competitve pricing strategies.

customery advisory systems: Powering AI chatbots or recommender systems for personalized laptop suggestions.

Product valuation tools: Used by resellers to asses fair price for second hand laptops.

## Conclusion

Succesfully demonstrated the use of Python , machine learning , and visualization tools to perform price prediction.

Reinforced core concepts of data cleaning , feature engineering , and regression modelling.

Provided hands on experience in using structured data for solving real world business problems.
